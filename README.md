# Sisku

*Currently under development. The current implementation is only experimental to validate the idea.*

Polyglot API search engine on LSP/LSIF.

Sisku allows you to search libraries by function names,  signatures, or a query like "open a file".
Sisku uses informations from LSP/LSIF, so it is not depend on specific programming language.
If your programming language supports LSP/LSIF, you can use Sisku for searching libraries (probably).
